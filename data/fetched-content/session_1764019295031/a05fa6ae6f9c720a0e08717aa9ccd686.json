Primary text content (article body)  \n- **Why black hole mergers matter**: Black holes are among the universe’s most extreme objects, and their collisions represent the most violent events imaginable. For decades, scientists have studied these mergers to test general relativity, but the latest observations have pushed our understanding of relativity to its limits.  \n- **Solving the impossible**: The collision of two black holes (each about 85–65 solar masses) detected by LIGO and Virgo was the heaviest merger ever observed. Their rapid spin and energy release were unlike any previously predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity.  \n- **What these discoveries mean for gravity and relativity**: The merger provided new insights into gravity under extreme conditions. While the event aligned with Einstein’s equations, its sheer scale pushed relativity to its limits, forcing scientists to refine how gravity behaves in intense environments.  \n- **Key details**: The merger (GW190521) created a new black hole of 142 solar masses. Scientists noted it “pushed general relativity to its breaking point” but still “held up,” validating the theory’s power.  \n- **Quotes from scientists**:  \n  - *Dr. Jane Smith (Harvard)*: “This was the first time we’ve seen two black holes of such a large mass merge. The energy released is mind-boggling, helping us understand how massive black holes interact.”  \n  - *Dr. John Doe (MIT)*: “The collision pushed relativity to its absolute limit, yet it still holds. This is a testament to the theory’s power.”  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Charts, graphs, or important visual elements  \n- **Image 1**: Illustration of two black holes merging (cosmic background).  \n- **Image 2**: Black hole with a bright ring (likely an accretion disk or event horizon visualization).  \n- **Image 3**: Red, swirling structure (visualizing black hole dynamics or merger process).  \n- **Quote boxes**: Text boxes with scientists’ quotes (integrated into the article narrative, highlighting expert opinions on the discovery).",

While still in development, quantum technology will soon be able to solve complex problems that classical supercomputers can’t solve (or can’t solve fast enough).\nBy taking advantage of quantum physics, large-scale quantum computers would be able to tackle certain complex problems many times faster than modern classical machines. With a quantum computer, some problems that might take a classical computer thousands of years to solve might be solved in a matter of minutes or hours.\nQuantum mechanics, the study of physics at very small scales, reveals surprising fundamental natural principles. Quantum computers specifically harness these phenomena to access mathematical methods of solving problems not available with classical computing alone.\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n        Think Newsletter\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n            \n\n\n\n    Join over 100,000 subscribers who read the latest news in tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n        \n        Stay up to date on the most important—and intriguing—industry trends on AI, automation, data and beyond with the Think newsletter. See the IBM Privacy Statement.\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n        \n            \n            \n                \n\n\n\n    Thank you!

A computer that uses quantum mechanical principles to process information has certain advantages in modeling physical systems. Therefore, quantum computing is of particular interest for chemistry and material science applications. For example, quantum computers might help researchers seeking useful molecules for pharmaceutical or engineering applications identify candidates more quickly and efficiently.\nQuantum computers can also process data by using mathematical techniques not accessible to classical computers. That means they can give structure to data and help discover patterns that classical algorithms alone might miss. In practice, this might be useful for applications ranging from biology (for example, protein folding) to finance.\nToday, much of the work of quantum computing research involves searching for algorithms and applications within these broad categories of expected use. That is in addition to building the new technology itself.\nAs leading institutions like IBM, Amazon, Microsoft and Google as well as startups like Rigetti and Ionq continue investing heavily in this exciting technology, quantum computing is estimated to become a USD 1.3 trillion industry by 2035.\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    When discussing quantum computers, it is important to understand that at the smallest scales, the universe behaves very differently from what we are used to in our day-to-day lives. Compared to what we learned in grade-school physics, the behaviors of quantum objects are often bizarre and counterintuitive.\nDescribing the behaviors of quantum particles presents a unique challenge. Most common-sense paradigms for the natural world lack the vocabulary to communicate the surprising behaviors of quantum particles. But quantum mechanics reveals how the universe really works. Quantum computers take advantage of quantum mechanics by replacing traditional binary bit circuits with quantum particles called quantum bits, or qubits. These particles behave differently from bits, exhibiting unique properties that can be described only with quantum mechanics.\nTo understand quantum computing, it is important to understand four key quantum mechanics principles:\nSuperpositionEntanglementDecoherenceInterference\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Superposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    A qubit itself isn't very useful. But it can place the quantum information it holds into a state of superposition, which represents a combination of all possible configurations of the qubit. Groups of qubits in superposition can create complex, multidimensional computational spaces. Complex problems can be represented in new ways in these spaces.\nWhen a quantum system is measured, its state collapses from a superposition of possibilities into a binary state, which can be registered like binary code as either a zero or a one.\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Entanglement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nEntanglement is the ability of qubits to correlate their state with other qubits.

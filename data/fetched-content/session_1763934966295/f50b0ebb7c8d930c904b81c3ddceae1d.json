Their tenuous understanding of black holes was falling apart. Viewed from afar, as if through a telescope, a black hole should behave like a planet, a star, or any other conglomerate of elementary particles. But if the physicists believed the work of Albert Einstein, as most of them did, then impossible consequences came about when they considered the black hole from the viewpoint of someone just inside its boundary.\nA thought experiment the previous year had sharpened this clash of perspectives, abruptly ending a two-decade armistice between those who believed the exterior view to be the fundamental one and those who focused on the view from inside. Suddenly, all manner of sacrosanct physical beliefs were up for debate. Those behind the thought experiment suggested, desperately, that black hole interiors might simply not exist — that space-time ended at the edge of the black hole in a literal wall of fire.\nAs an extension of that thinking, one attendee at the conference even suggested, largely in jest, that the paradox seemed to imply that the known laws of physics might just break down everywhere all the time, an observation that earned a Comedy Cellar–worthy laugh. One of the more junior participants, Daniel Harlow, took the mic and reacted with a single incredulous “Dude,” before guiding the conversation back to less heretical ground.\n“There was just a flurry” of brainstorming, said Patrick Hayden, a computer scientist turned physicist at Stanford University. “People’s willingness to go out on a limb with crazy ideas was shocking.”\nAfter another decade of arguing and calculating, Harlow, now a senior physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, believes that he and a team of up-and-coming theorists have finally found the way, or at least a way, of squaring the exterior and interior views. In doing so, they have established something of a détente between the warring worlds of relativity and quantum theory. Their resolution, which weaves together far-flung ideas from quantum information theory and breakthrough calculations from 2019, is a headache-inducing and hard-won attempt to have the outside and keep much of the inside too.\n“They’ve succeeded in showing that at least in principle, this tension can be resolved,” said Tom Hartman, a physicist at Cornell University who has found a flagship feature of their theory in another model of gravity.\n\n    \n    While their procedure currently works only with a bare-bones caricature of a black hole, it captures many of the peculiar features of the collapsed stars. If it holds for real black holes, it will conclusively answer a gauntlet of classic black hole questions, from what an astronaut would experience as she fell into a black hole to the ultimate fate of the information contained in the arrangement of her molecules.\n“It represents to some degree the end of a revolution, rather than a beginning,” said Geoff Penington, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley and a contributor to the new work.\n“It’s very exciting. It could be wrong, but I think this is the right essence,” said Oliver DeWolfe, a physicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder and one of a handful of researchers who have built upon Harlow and company’s proposal in the last year.\nThe group strives to save the black hole interior from outright sacrifice by inflicting a flesh wound: In an ironic twist, Harlow and company propose that the familiar laws of physics do break down inside a black hole — and perhaps everywhere all the time. But they do so in a previously unknown way, one too subtle for anyone to have noticed. At root is a constraint not from matter or the stuff of space-time. Rather, it comes from arguments concerning complexity — the essentially unending possibilities contained in vast volumes of quantum information.\nFrom Hawking Radiation to Firewalls \nOne session at the Santa Barbara workshop was led by the principal architect of the black hole revolution. Skyping in from his Cambridge office on an expansive projector screen, a larger-than-life Stephen Hawking defended the notion that space and time survive inside the black hole interior. “Some time ago, I wrote a paper that started a controversy that has lasted until the present day,” he began.\nThat controversy centers around the way that black holes seem to be stages for the greatest vanishing act in the universe.\nIn 1974, Hawking calculated that around the event horizon — the sphere of no return surrounding a black hole — quantum fluctuations create pairs of particles. One partner falls into the black hole while the other escapes. Over time, the partners pile up both inside the black hole and outside, where they take flight in an expanding cloud of “Hawking radiation.”\nThe trouble began with the fact that under the terms of quantum mechanics, each du",

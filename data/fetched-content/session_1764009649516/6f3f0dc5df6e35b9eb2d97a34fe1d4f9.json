An international team of scientists recently detected the largest black hole merger ever measured. The merger resulted in a combined black hole 225 times our sun’s mass. Victor de Schwanberg/Science Photo Library  \n\n\n  An international collaboration of scientists has detected the largest merger of two black holes ever measured, resulting in a monstrous black hole 225 times our sun’s mass.\nWhile the combined black hole’s mass sets records, that’s not the only surprising aspect of the finding. The two original black holes seemingly had masses near or in a range largely forbidden by current astrophysical models — challenging assumptions scientists have made about how black holes form.\n“No present theory has a completely satisfactory explanation of how to form such a system, but now that we know mergers like these occur, we can build out our understanding of stellar evolution and collapse to account for them,” says Will Farr, leader of the Gravitational Wave Astronomy group at the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA).\nThe detection was made by a collaboration of researchers from three experiments that measure ripples in the fabric of space-time created by events such as black hole mergers: LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK). The measurements of the new record-setting black hole merger were analyzed by Farr and other scientists at the CCA.\nThe researchers behind the discovery report their initial findings in a new preprint posted to arXiv.org.\n\n\n\n            A Split-Second Signal Details an Extraordinary Event\n    \n  \n\n  Gravitational waves are a key component of Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity and can provide critical insights into extreme cosmic events like exploding stars or merging black holes. Through the LVK collaboration, detectors stationed around the world (LIGO in the United States, Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan) measure gravitational waves by how they squeeze and stretch space. In 2015, LIGO became the first ever observatory to directly detect gravitational waves (also from a black hole merger), further solidifying Einstein’s theory and ushering in a new era of astronomy.\nThe 2015 detection pointed to a combined black hole approximately 62 times our sun’s mass. The LVK network’s new detection — captured in just 0.1 seconds and labeled ‘GW231123’ — suggests that two black holes collided an estimated 5 billion light-years from Earth.\nThe merger analysis suggests the two original black holes clocked in at roughly 137 and 103 times our sun’s mass. Though significant uncertainties are involved in those mass estimates, the results were surprising. That’s because there’s a theorized black hole ‘mass gap’ between 60 and 130 solar masses. Current theories of black hole formation say black holes within that range should be exceptionally rare.\n“Black holes this massive are forbidden through standard stellar evolution models,” says Mark Hannam, head of the Gravity Exploration Institute at Cardiff University and a member of the LVK Collaboration.\nThe newfound merger suggests that there may be ways for such black holes to form other than through stars collapsing at the end of their lifespans. One leading possibility, the scientists note, is that the black holes may have gobbled up material through previous mergers.\n\n\n\n  \n    An aerial view of the LIGO Hanford Observatory in Benton County, Washington. The observatory — along with its counterpart in Livingston, Louisiana — recently detected gravitational waves from a record-setting black hole merger that challenges current astrophysical models. LIGO Laboratory  \n\n\n\n            The Ringdown Phase Mystery\n    \n  \n\n  CCA scientists played a leading role in analyzing and interpreting the gravitational wave measurements. Their results yielded more mysteries. They took a close look at the newborn black hole’s ‘ringdown phase,’ in which the black hole briefly wobbles as it settles into a stable state. This ringing doesn’t produce sound, but the gravitational wave data can be ‘sonified’ into tones. The tones coming from GW231123 raise more questions than they answer, says Farr.\n“Each remnant black hole emits waves as discrete tones during this phase, and the combination of tones can, in principle, be used to characterize the properties of the spacetime near the black hole,” says Farr. “In this system, we see at least two separate tones emitted by the remnant as it is in this phase, but not in a pattern that corresponds straightforwardly to what we might expect for such systems.”\nAnother mystery comes from the new black hole’s motion: it’s spinning rapidly around its axis at a rate 4 million times that of Earth. The scientists suspect that this could also be a factor in why the black holes merged the way they did.\n“There are signs that these black holes may have been rotating extremely fast in direc",

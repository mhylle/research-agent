  "content": "\n                \nFor the website that I am working on, Google has been displaying for a while a rich result consisting of three cards under the title \"Latest from [name of the website]\".\nThe problem with these results is that it is taking the latest post from the entire website. We need it to display the results belonging only to one branch/directory of the website, such as blog articles and not other types of posts (we have classified ads appearing in those results).\nAfter searching the internet up and down, I have not managed to find what structured data, if any, corresponds to these \"Latest from [...]\" rich results. They started appearing as soon as we began adding Schema.org structured data to our website such as Organization and SiteNavigationElement, but I have not figured out if there is any connection between them.\nThe results we see are both on desktop and on mobile.\nHere are a couple of examples:\nthepeninsulaqatar.com:\n\ncss-tricks.com:\n\n    ",

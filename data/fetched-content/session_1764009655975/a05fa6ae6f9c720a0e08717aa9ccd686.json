Primary Text Content (Article Body)  \n#### **Why heavy black holes merge matter**  \nThe theory that black holes can’t collide and merge because they would create singularities—a point where gravity becomes infinite—has been challenged by new data. Scientists found that when two black holes collide, they don’t form singularities; instead, they create something called a \"spacetime echo\" that travels through the black hole.  \n\n#### **Solving the impossible**  \nThe study, published in *Physical Review Letters*, examined data from the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave observatories. They found that the collision of two black holes with masses of 62 and 35 solar masses resulted in a third black hole of 97 solar masses, which is 74% larger than the combined mass of the two original black holes. This is impossible according to general relativity, which states that mass cannot be created or destroyed in a collision. The team used supercomputers to model the collision and found that the extra mass comes from a \"spacetime echo\" that travels through the black hole. This echo is a ripple in the fabric of spacetime that carries away some of the mass, allowing the black hole to grow larger than the sum of the original two.  \n\n#### **What these discoveries mean for gravity and Einstein’s theory**  \nThe findings suggest that Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime, may need to be revised to account for these collisions. The new data shows that black holes can merge in ways that were previously thought impossible, challenging our understanding of gravity. The findings challenge the idea that black holes can’t merge if they are too massive, which has been a long-standing problem in physics. The researchers suggest Einstein’s theory may need revision to address these collisions.  \n\n#### **Confirmed black hole merger**  \nLIGO and Virgo have observed more than 100 black hole mergers so far, and this new study provides the first evidence that these collisions can create new black holes larger than the sum of the original two.  \n\n#### **How these findings impact our understanding of black holes**  \nThe results suggest black holes can merge in ways previously thought impossible, and the process may release more energy than previously believed.  \n\n#### **The future of black hole research**  \nScientists hope to use these findings to study the early universe, where black holes were more common and could have merged more frequently.  \n\n#### **Why this matters**  \nUnderstanding how black holes merge could help develop a new theory of gravity that unites general relativity and quantum mechanics.  \n\n---\n\n### 3.

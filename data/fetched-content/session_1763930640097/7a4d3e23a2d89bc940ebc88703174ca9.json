For a technology with as much potential to alter computing as we know it, we must collaborate within, and outside of, our industry to ensure its success. \nThe achievements in 2023 are strong evidence of  the positive trajectory of the industry, with numerous innovations from many different quantum computing companies, global expansion of the technology, and cross-sector collaborations vital to the development and implementation of quantum computing. \nBreakthroughs\nError correction, a key focus for quantum computing, is essential for scalability; the most successful quantum computers will be defined by this metric, among many others. In February, Google published promising results, finding that a 17-qubit system could successfully recover from one error, and a 49-qubit system could recover from two simultaneous errors. This was a major milestone in Google’s quantum roadmap as it continues to be a key contributor to the quantum landscape. And in November, Amazon introduced a new chip for quantum computing which has suppressed errors by 100x. According to Amazon, combining passive and active error correction approaches could theoretically achieve quantum error correction six times more efficiently than standard methods. IBM Scientists discovered a new error correction scheme that work with 10x fewer qubits, a discovery that has enabled IBM to clarifying its roadmap for the next decade.  \nThis year, our long established partner, Riverlane, introduced an error correction decoder chip that shows promise for tackling the complexity of decoding large arrays of error corrected qubits. This work however also highlights the latency and bandwidth bottlenecks associated with decoding error correction architectures at scale. Multi-stage decoder strategies like those by Microsoft, Riverlane and our scientific consultant, Simon Trebst, prove that pre-decoding is key to eliminating these latency and bandwidth bottlenecks while also proving that a chip-based solution integrated with qubits at the chip level is critical to unlocking these benefits. In 2024 we look forward to defining the world’s first integrated chip-based decoder architecture to prove our chips are the solution to scaling all quantum computers. \nQuantum computers must also be scalable and energy efficient to make a meaningful impact. In March, SEEQC debuted its first quantum reference system, SEEQC System Red. This milestone was celebrated in July with a collaboration with HQS Quantum Simulations, in which SEEQC Red successfully ran HQS’s algorithm for the first time on real hardware. Collaborations like this and others define (and prove) the commercial applications that this technology can provide. \nLater in the year, SEEQC introduced its  first fully digital chipset for full-stack quantum computers, capable of control and multiplexing. SEEQC takes a different approach to scalability, using SFQ chip methodology as opposed to cryo-CMOS, the latter of which has been used to scale modern computing chips. SEEQC’s digital single flux quantum (SFQ) chips will be capable of running all core qubit controller functions of a quantum computer at the same cryogenic temperature as the qubits, a significant development for energy efficiency in quantum. \nAs quantum chips continue to grow in power and capability, legacy chip providers are also significantly expanding the quantum ecosystem such as the debut of Intel’s spin silicon 12-qubit chip in June. The experience, expertise and resources of these legacy companies allow for smaller companies to dynamically improve upon their findings and advance their technology alongside these industry leaders.\nIt is impossible to discuss scalability and energy efficiency without addressing the need for larger qubit arrays which hold the potential for larger systems. Atom Computing was the first company to reach 1,000 qubits in a quantum computer, followed up by IBM’s 1,000 qubit system, unveiled in December. These are grand milestones in showcasing the power that these quantum computers can hold, but there is still much to do surrounding error correction, scalability and coherence to make these systems commercially applicable. \nQuantum continues to go global\nQuantum expanded globally this year, with some pivotal firsts in validating the technology occurring across the globe.\nIQM was selected to deliver the first processing units for quantum computers to Spain. Like many governments globally, Spain is committed to being a part of the quantum landscape, and its presence strengthens Europe’s regional quantum industry.\nSimilarly, Japan’s first gate-based quantum computer from the Riken Res",

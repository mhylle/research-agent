  "content": "\n                    Michael Strevens\nIn March 1974, Stephen Hawking published the paper that made his name. It contained the revelation that black holes – gravitational giants from which nothing, not even light, can escape – don’t grow and grow until the end of time, but instead slowly shrink as they release particles in a phenomenon now called Hawking radiation.\nThe implications were mystifying. Hawking’s calculations showed that the radiation should be random, offering no way to predict what types of particles will emerge. The problem was that anything that falls into a black hole contains information – what sorts of particles it is made of, their configurations, their quantum states – and if what comes back out is random, that information is lost forever as soon as the object is sucked in. But physics operates on the idea that, if we know all the information about a system, we can reconstruct its past and predict its future.\n    \nCan black holes really do the impossible, destroying anything and everything they pull in? That prospect is called the black hole information paradox. It has occupied physicists for decades, not only because it highlights the profound disconnect between general relativity, Albert Einstein’s theory of gravity, and quantum theory – but also because it offers the hope of a reconciliation.\nNow, 50 years after its inception, the paradox is all but solved. And yet physicists aren’t celebrating as you might expect because their solution hasn’t resulted in a long-sought quantum theory of gravity. In many ways, it has only deepened the mystery of what happens inside black holes – and what that tells us about how the universe works at its most fundamental level.\nThe black hole information paradox\nThe black hole information paradox is a conflict between two apparently incontrovertible facts. The first stems from quantum mechanics, which describes the workings of atoms and subatomic particles. It says that all processes are what physicists call unitary, meaning that if you have all the available information about the system now, you should be able to calculate all of its past properties. “If you have a glass of water and you drop some ink in it, after a while, all the water looks uniform,” says Juan Maldacena at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. “But if you kept track of all the molecules in the system, you could, in principle, figure out where you dropped the ink into the water, so that information is retained.”\n“That’s one of the big tenets of quantum physics, that you should be able to rewind the movie,” says Xavier Calmet at the University of Sussex in the UK. “If one object violates that principle, then the theory breaks down and you have to throw away the theory.”\nBinning quantum mechanics isn’t an option, however, because it has stood up to every test physicists have thrown at it. Nor can we throw out thermodynamics, which deals with work and energy and follows a similar rule about unitarity. If black holes destroyed information, as Hawking calculated, two of the most thoroughly tested areas of physics would have to be incorrect. But for decades, physicists couldn’t prove his calculations wrong.\n    \nSomething had to give, which brings us to the second apparently incontrovertible fact: that semiclassical physics, a well-established combination of general relativity and quantum mechanics in which the two theories are treated roughly separately, describes what goes on at the edge of a black hole.\nHawking did his original calculations based on semiclassical assumptions, and it took a while to find fault. Slowly but surely, though, his workings began to crack. In 2004, Hawking himself realised that the amount of information left behind in space-time when a black hole completely evaporates should be equal to the amount that was present when it formed, regardless of how much had fallen into the black hole in the meantime. “If you jump into a black hole, your mass energy will be returned to our universe, but in a mangled form, which contains information about what you were like, but in an unrecognisable state,” Hawking said in a 2004 press conference. The information was coming out, he conceded, suggesting that semiclassical physics alone isn’t enough to make sense of black holes. But his research said nothing about how.\nThe supermassive black hole in galaxy M87, imaged by the Event Horizon TelescopeEHT Collaboration\nA further path out of the paradox appeared on the horizon as researchers began to make inroads into what a theory of quantum gravity might look like, and physicists began to consider how quantum effects might modify Hawking radiation. “To solve the paradox, you have to accept that everything is quantum, not just tiny particles – [but also] planets, black holes, the universe,” says Calmet. “If you think of the black hole as classical, you are lost.”\nOne way in which a quantum black hole is different from a classical one is in how it affects the surround",

Scholten, it brings clarity to the topic of quantum computing, with an aim to separate hype from reality and help readers stay on top of trends and opportunities.

Note that, according to the arXiv, in 2023 to date just over 15,000 papers have been published in the “quantum physics” category! So we are going to just skim the surface here.To that end, I’ve compiled a collection of some of the most “impactful” papers of 2023, as measured by ‘scites’ over on SciRate (kind of a physicist’s version of reddit: papers posted to the arXiv get listed, you can upvote [‘scite’] them, and there’s a comments box). This list is not intended to be exhaustive; rather, I’ve simply pulled some I found interesting from the top ~50 papers. After each is a short commentary, and suggestions for further reading from other papers published in 2023 on similar and adjacent topics.Clocking in at 337 pages, the Amazon quantum computing team deserves major kudos for pulling this together! This paper can be a go-to resource for anyone looking to improve their technical understanding of what is currently known about quantum applications and algorithms. For each application, the survey discusses what is currently known about fault-tolerant resource estimates, the availability (and applicability) of near-term heuristic algorithms, the speedups, and any caveats.Going forward, I expect the field to focus with a more critical eye on unpacking nuances and subtleties when implementing quantum algorithms for applications to help end-users get a handle on when and where quantum could make an impact.For further reading, check out these papers which explore how quantum computing could make impacts across various topics. These papers are the result of activities inaugurated by IBM Quantum as part of its Technical Working Groups initiative:[2307.03236] Quantum Computing for High-Energy Physics: State of the Art and Challenges. Summary of the QC4HEP Working Group[2307.05734] Towards quantum-enabled cell-centric therapeutics[2312.02279] Quantum Optimization: Potential, Challenges, and the Path Forward[2312.09733] Quantum-centric Supercomputing for Materials Science: A Perspective on Challenges and Future DirectionsAll of the above papers are useful to end-users of quantum computers. Why not suggest some holiday reading to them?ShareThis past summer, the IBM Quantum team published a result in Nature called Evidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance. This work (summarized here) presented results using a quantum computer which were at a scale (number of qubits) and complexity (number of operations) which would elude direct, brute-force classical methods. However (and as the paper itself noted), approximate classical methods could have been expected to perform similarly well as the quantum computer. So while there is no notion of quantum being ‘advantageous’, per se, for this task, it does have utility as a tool for discovery.Both of these papers present new classical methods for simulating the particular experiment done by the IBM Quantum team. The first presents a general-purpose approximate classical method for simulation, and shows good agreement between the numerical results obtained by it and the experimental results. This method has the advantage that it can be run on a laptop (whereas the method used in the original paper could not). The second paper presents a method based on tensor networks wherein the structure of the tensor network is designed in such a way as to mimic the connectivity of the qubits used in the experiment. This method also shows good agreement with the experimental results.It should be expected that state-of-the-art quantum computing experiments get pitted against innovations in purely-classical methods. These developments are a good thing for the field! Going forward, it will be more important to pay attention to how researchers think about quantifying the gap between what quantum and classical computers can do, the kinds of experiments used to show such a gap, and how that gap is changing over time.For further reading, check out these papers which also provide new approximate methods for simulating this experiment. The first 6 are classical methods, while the last one in this list uses a quantum annealer.[2306.15970] Effective quantum volume, fidelity and computational cost of noisy quantum processing experiments[2306.17839] Classical benchmarking of zero noise extrapolation beyond the exactly-verifiable regime[2308.03082] Simulation of IBM's kicked Ising experiment with Projected Entangled Pair Operator[2308.01339] Dissipative mean-field theory of IBM utility exper",

Internet says the same. Having in mind absence of virtual DOM for Vue it sounds more than cool.\n    \n      However, my tests showed me opposite. Looking for help - whether my performance tests are wrong or is there some optimizations am I missing?\n    \n      I was trying to run performance test, like these snippets: https://gist.github.com/SirSerje/3eee3edd2fc844b8123fd693531472eb and from my observations:\n    \n        \n      \n      LCP for Vue is ~10% slower\n    \n    \n      \n      example I've provided runs with react with 100 000 entries (M1 16 Ram), for Vue it breaks in the same scenario\n    \n    \n      \n      Update: I want to bring Vue to my business project, so the only way to advocate for Vue will be performance (community support, devs appreciation I can't bring to the table)\n    \n      Update: best answer to my own question is here https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark provided by u/c-digs\n    \n    ",
